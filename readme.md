### Livetext

- You are free to use this tool on respecting the license of the font you use to generate glyphs for using Livetext mod in Transport Fever
- This generator generates the glyphs meshes, mdl files, color materials and width/kerning informations
- The instruction to the generator is the livetext.json, when modifying this file, don't change the order of any fields since the parser in the generator is order-sensitive
- There will always be three colors generated: #FFFFFF, #000000 and #FFF2F2F2, the meshes generated are directly place under the mesh/livetext/[font] folder, other meshes for other colors are placed under a subfolder named after the concatenation of all color codes, in this way, the three most used colors can be shared between mods without causing crashes, and the meshes for other colors are more private than shared.
- .Net Framework 4.5 is required to use this generator
